# Data_Science_Python_Project
In my recent project, I had the opportunity to work with data from Gezinomi, a well-known travel company. This project was an excellent experience for me, allowing me to apply and consolidate the knowledge I’ve gained over time.

Throughout the project, I conducted various analyses and processes to understand the data better and derive meaningful insights. I explored different aspects of the dataset, such as unique cities and concepts, total earnings by city and concept, and average prices. This deep dive into the data helped me to see patterns and trends that are crucial for business decision-making.

One of the tasks involved transforming categorical variables and performing group-by operations to calculate average incomes and identify customer segments. While working on these tasks, I encountered several challenges and errors. For instance, I faced warnings related to changes in pandas' future versions and had to ensure that my code was compatible with these upcoming changes.

These challenges were not just obstacles but also learning opportunities. They taught me how to troubleshoot effectively, refine my coding practices, and adapt to evolving technologies. By the end of the project, I felt more confident in my ability to handle real-world data and perform complex analyses.

Overall, this project with Gezinomi’s data was invaluable. It reinforced my understanding of data analysis concepts and provided practical experience in dealing with real data, ultimately making me more proficient in my field.
